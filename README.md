# SocialNews
A news recommendation engine based social media network data of users.

It is a social recommendation system which uses social media mining and Natural Language Processing.

The users will be able to connect their social media network accounts (for supported networks) and provide required permissions to extract their interests and public trends. This data will be utilized to make the news recommendations.

Developers will be able to extend the system with their own interest extraction implementation for a new social network, currently not supported in the system by extending the social media feed mapper interface.
